## Background

This single web-application is a Sorting Algorithm Visualization engine for visualizing various sorting algorithms. This application sorts an unsorted array of numbers using a particular sorting algorithm which includes bubble sort, selection sort, and quick sort. This was developed because I struggled to visualize sorting algorithm in the beginning and had to draw it out for myself. Hence, I developed this to be used as a form of visual aid and for educational purposes.
